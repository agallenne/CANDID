# [C]ompanion [A]nalysis and [N]on-[D]etection in [I]nterferometric [D]ata

This is a suite of tools to find faint companion around star in interferometric data in the [OIFITS format](http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/research/optical-interferometry/oifits/). This tool allows to systematically search for faint companions in OIFITS data, and if not found, estimates the detection limit.

## What does it do for you?

### Companion Search

The tool is based on model fitting and Chi2 minimization ([scipy.optimize.leastsq](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.leastsq.html)), with a grid for the starting points of the companion position. It ensures that all positions are explored by estimating a-posteriori if the grid was dense enough, and provide an estimate of the optimum gride density (see example).

### Detection limit
It uses Chi2 statistics to estimate the level of detection in "number of sigmas".

### Non-Detection Limit
There are 2 approachs inplemented: [Absil et al. 2011](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...535A..68A) and CANDID's Analytical Companion Injection (Gallenne et al. 2015, in preparation).

## Known limitations

The code has *not* been deeply error proofed. If you encounter problems or bugs, do not hesitate to contact the developpers.

* The code works only with a single OIFITS file. You will need an external tool to combine OIFITS files
* the "flags" in OIFITS are not yet taken into account. Will come soon
* The works only with simple OIFITS files: all observations should be with the same instrument (same OI_WAVELENGTH) and all data will be taken, assuming a single target is present.
* The code has been tested of OIFITS files form CHARA/MIRC and VLTI/PIONIER. If you use other instruments and encounter problems, please contact the developpers!
* The code is not particularly fast, but uses [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html): our experience on Macs is that it leads to several problems:
** does not work properly with IPython Notebooks. [It seems to be known](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/6109).
** It works better with the IPython console, though it sometimes seem unresponsive (it makes sometimes the estimation of running time unreliable). Morover ctrl+C does not stop the code.
** The smoothest behavior is obtained by running in a python shell.
* The code can take lots of memory because it storse lots of intermediate reuslts, so using a 64bit python is advisable
